# Gaeta eSports team's official discord bot

**What the story behind this discord bot?**

I wanted to create my own discord bot. I found out it is possible by following up the tutorials of CodeLyon's on YouTube.
<br>I introduced the idea of creating the Gaeta eSport's own discord bot. The people in the Gaeta eSports culture loved the idea. Thus, I made one.
<br>Made with discord.js library of node.js.

**You made it in node.js, but we can't see "node-modules" folder**

I assume this folder should be ready on your side. Thanks.
